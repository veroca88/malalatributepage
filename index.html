<div id="main">Malala Yousafzai born 12 July 1997 in Mingora, Swat, Pakistan. She is known for human rights advocacy, especially
  the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local
  Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school.
  <ul>
    <li>In early 2009, when she was 11–12, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during
      the Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about
      her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and
      on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.</li>
    <li>On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the Swat District, after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were
      shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai
      was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of
      Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham,
      UK. The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for Yousafzai.</li>
    <li> In 2012, she was the recipient of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize.</li>
    <li>Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become "the most famous teenager in the world". Following
      her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based out of Birmingham.</li>
    <li>In 2013, she founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation, and co-authored I am Malala, an international best
      seller.
    </li>
    <li>In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi. Aged 17 at the time,
      this made her the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.</li>
    <li>In 2015, Yousafzai was a subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala.</li>
    <li>In 2017, she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons
      of Canada. Yousafzai attended Edgbaston High School from 2013 to 2017, and is currently studying for a bachelor's degree
      in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.</li>
