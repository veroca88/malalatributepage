      <p>Welcoming a girl is not always cause for celebration in Pakistan said Malala and the most frustrating thing is that
        it's not only in that country. this religious, cultural and belief problem is unfortunately spread throughout the
        world.

      <p>Malala loved school. But everything changed when the Taliban took control of her town in Swat Valley. The extremists
        banned many things — like owning a television and playing music — and enforced harsh punishments for those who defied
        their orders. And they said girls could no longer go to school.</p></div>

      <p>In January 2008 when she was just 11 years old, She said goodbye to her classmates, not knowing when — if ever —
        she would see them again.I spoke out publicly on behalf of girls and our right to learn. And this made me a target.
      </p>
      <p>In October 2012, on her way home from school, a masked gunman boarded her school bus and asked, “Who is Malala?”
        He shot her on the left side of her head.</p>
      <p>She woke up 10 days later in a hospital in Birmingham, England. The doctors and nurses told me about the attack
        — and that people around the world were praying for my recovery.</p></div>
